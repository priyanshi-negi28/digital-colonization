# Digital Colonization: Who Owns Your Screen

This project is a visual investigation into how youth around the world are influenced, shaped, and even controlled by digital platforms — most of which are not locally owned. From screen time to ownership patterns, data flows to legal protections — this dashboard lays it out.

This isn’t just data. It’s a narrative.

## What's in it?

- Youth Dependency Index — How much local youth rely on foreign platforms
- Platform Ownership Map — Who owns what you're using every day
- Cross-Border Data Flow — Where your data is going
- Local Alternatives Usage — Are we building and actually using our own?
- Digital Policy Comparison — Which countries are actually doing something about it
- Attention Exploitation Index — A metric for how platforms monetize your time

## Tech Stack
